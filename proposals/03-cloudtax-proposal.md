# Partnership Proposal: CloudTax

**From:** [Your Name / CityHelper]  
**To:** CloudTax Team  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Subject:** Strategic Partnership — AI Tax Prep + Your Filing Engine

---

## Hi CloudTax Team,

I'm reaching out because I believe there's a strong partnership opportunity between what you've built and what we're building.

---

## The Short Version

**You have:** NETFILE certification, a tax engine, Canadian tax expertise.

**We're building:** CityHelper — an AI assistant that makes tax prep feel like texting a friend.

**Together:** We could serve users who find traditional tax software intimidating, and give them a seamless path from confused → filed.

---

## What We're Building

An AI-powered personal compliance assistant for Canadians:

- **Conversational tax prep** — "Upload your T4" becomes "Take a photo, I'll handle it"
- **OCR document scanning** — Extract data from slips automatically
- **Smart deduction finder** — "Did you work from home? Take transit? Have kids?"
- **Year-round tracking** — Not just taxes, but licenses, deadlines, renewals

Our gap: **We don't have NETFILE certification, and we don't want to reinvent the wheel.**

## Why CloudTax

I specifically reached out to CloudTax because:

1. **You're Canadian-built** — You understand our market
2. **You're growing** — Agile enough to explore partnerships
3. **Aligned mission** — Making taxes accessible to all Canadians
4. **Not a mega-corp** — We can actually talk to decision makers

## What I'm Proposing

| Model | How It Works | Revenue |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **API Access** | We call your API to submit returns | Per-filing fee ($X) |
| **White-Label** | We use your engine, our UX | Revenue share |
| **Handoff** | We prep, redirect to CloudTax to file | Referral fee |

I'm flexible on the model — I just want to find something that works for both of us.

## What's In It For CloudTax

- **New user channel** — Users who wouldn't find you otherwise
- **Zero support burden** — Our AI handles the Q&A
- **Incremental revenue** — Users we send are ready to file
- **AI innovation** — Partner with AI-first approach without building it yourself

---

## Let's Chat

I'd love a 15-20 minute call to explore this further. No pressure — just a conversation to see if there's a fit.
