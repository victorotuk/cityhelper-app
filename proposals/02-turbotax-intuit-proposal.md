# Partnership Proposal: TurboTax / Intuit Canada

**From:** [Your Name / CityHelper]  
**To:** Intuit Canada — Strategic Partnerships  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Subject:** AI Distribution Partnership Proposal

---

## Executive Summary

We're developing CityHelper — a next-generation AI assistant for Canadian personal compliance — covering taxes, government deadlines, and life admin.

We want to partner with TurboTax to serve as a **distribution and preparation channel** that feeds ready-to-file users into your ecosystem.

## The Opportunity

**The problem we solve:** Most Canadians procrastinate on taxes because the process feels overwhelming. They don't know what documents they need, what deductions they qualify for, or where to start.

**Our solution:** An AI that makes tax prep feel like texting a friend. By the time users reach the filing step, they have everything organized and ready.

**Where you come in:** NETFILE submission + final review for users who want professional-grade filing.
