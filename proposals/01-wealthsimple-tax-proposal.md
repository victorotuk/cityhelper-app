## Executive Summary

We're building CityHelper — an AI-powered personal compliance assistant that helps Canadians track and manage all their government obligations — taxes, licenses, renewals, and deadlines.

We're seeking a partnership with Wealthsimple Tax to handle the NETFILE submission component of our tax preparation flow.

**The opportunity:** We bring you new users who are already tax-ready. You handle the filing.

## What We're Building

- Guides users through tax preparation via conversational interface
- Scans and extracts data from T4s, T5s, receipts using OCR
- Calculates taxes owed/refunds automatically
- Identifies deductions users typically miss
- Prepares complete, ready-to-file returns

**What we need from you:** NETFILE submission capability via API or white-label integration.
