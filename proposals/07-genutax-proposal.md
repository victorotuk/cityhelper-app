**Date:** December 2024  
**Subject:** Integration Partnership — AI Meets Proven Tax Software

## Hi GenuTax Team,

I've been impressed by what GenuTax offers — free, capable tax software for Canadians. The fact that you've been doing this for years shows real commitment to accessibility.

I'm building CityHelper — something that could complement what you do, and I wanted to explore a partnership.

## What I'm Building

An AI-powered "life admin" assistant for Canadians that handles:
- Tax preparation (through conversation, not forms)
- Document scanning and data extraction
- Reminders for all government deadlines
- Compliance tracking year-round

The AI guides users to gather documents, identifies deductions, and prepares everything for filing.

**My gap:** NETFILE certification.

## The Proposal

A simple integration:

1. **Our AI prepares the user** — Gathers docs, calculates, identifies deductions
2. **We generate a GenuTax-compatible file** — Or integrate directly
3. **User files through GenuTax** — You handle NETFILE submission

We could structure this as:
- Technical integration (file format handoff)
- Embedded widget
- Simple redirect with pre-filled data

## What's In It For GenuTax

- **More users** — People who find traditional tax software intimidating
- **Better prepared users** — Less confusion, fewer support questions
- **Aligned values** — We both want to make taxes accessible

## Let's Talk

I'm not looking for anything complicated — just a conversation to see if our approaches could work together.
