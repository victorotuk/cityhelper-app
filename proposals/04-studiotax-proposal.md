# Partnership Proposal: StudioTax

**From:** [Your Name / CityHelper]  
**To:** StudioTax Team  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry — AI-Assisted Tax Preparation

---

## Hello,

I've been a fan of what StudioTax has done — offering free, quality tax software to Canadians. That's a mission I respect.

I'm reaching out because I'm building something complementary, and I think there might be an opportunity to work together.

---

## What I'm Building

CityHelper — an AI assistant that helps Canadians with all their government "life admin":
- Taxes
- License renewals
- Deadlines
- Compliance tracking

For the tax piece, I'm building conversational AI that:
- Guides users through what they need to gather
- Scans and extracts data from T4s, T5s, receipts
- Identifies deductions they might miss
- Prepares everything for filing

**The gap:** I don't have NETFILE certification, and honestly, I don't want to spend a year getting it when experts like you already have it.

---

## What I'm Proposing

A simple partnership where:

1. Our AI prepares users completely
2. We hand off to StudioTax for the actual filing
3. We either pay a per-filing fee OR drive donations your way

I know StudioTax operates on a donation model, and I want to respect that. I'm happy to structure this in a way that supports your model.

## Why This Could Work

- **You get users who are already prepared** — Less friction, better experience
- **I get NETFILE capability** — Without reinventing the wheel
- **Users win** — Best of both worlds (AI + proven tax software)

## Interested?

I'd love to chat — even just 15 minutes to see if there's potential here.
